# Problems
In this documentation we want to provide the most common problems we had while developing the app. <br />

This documentation is also a good start for developers never worked with ionic and only got an average understanding of web/app development. Have a look at the table of contents to find a problem you wanna read more about. <br />


Feel free to extend the documentation for other developers and create an new entry. Please use the <a href="template.md">template</a> to structure your entry.
