# CORS issue
## Problem
### Description
While developing we had the problem that our app got served at 'localhost:7777'. When we made an API request to an other server the browser denied the request. <br />

## Explaination
CORS is an acronym for Cross-Origin-Resoruce-Sharing. That means that in the case of our API request we wanted the API server to share a resource with us. When we make the request our origin was 'origin=localhost:7777' and the origin of the server was 'origin=ics.mosbach.dhbw.de'. Because the two origins were different the browser blocked the request.

## Solution
The solution for this problem was pretty simple. We needed to create a proxy where we send our request to and the proxy forwareded the request to the server. The request of the server gets forwareded back to us throught the proxy. <br />

Angular/Ionic provides a simple configuration for those proxys. First we need to create the following file in the root of our project: <br />


**proxy.config.json:**
```json
{
  "/ics/*": {
    "target": {
        "host": "ics.mosbach.dhbw.de",
        "protocol": "http:"
      },
    "secure": false,
    "changeOrigin": true,
    "logLevel": "info"
  }
}
```
 <table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>"/ics/*"</b></td>
    <td>tells on what pattern the proxy should listen</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>target.host</b></td>
    <td>defines the origin of the real API server</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>target.protocol</b></td>
    <td>defines what protocol should be used</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>secure</b></td>
    <td>needs to be true if you want to use https</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>changeOrigin</b></td>
    <td>MUST be true in order to change the origin</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>logLevel</b></td>
    <td>of info simply logs the forwarded calls in the console</td>
  </tr>
 </table>


Here is shorter explaination of the forwarding:<br />

```
  Forwarded throught proxy:
  /ics/test => http://ics.mosbach.dhbw.de/ics/test
  
  What the browser shows:
  /ics/test => http://localhost:7777/ics/test
```

After we created our proxy we need to tell ionic to use it. There for we need to change the **run script** in the package.json of our root directory.

**package.json:**<br />
```json
"scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve --port 7777 --proxy-config proxy.config.json",
    "build": "ng build",
    "test": "ng test",
    "lint": "ng lint",
    "e2e": "ng e2e"
  },
  ```
Simply add  **--proxy-config proxy.config.json** to the start script.

DONE!!!
